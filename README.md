Background for Teachers

The entire project is created with a local community in mind. Students look at local restaurants and decide what new type of restaurant is needed. They fill out an application for the local Business Alliance. They examine real estate in their community for sale and select a location for their restaurant based upon the results. It’s a great way to link Business classes, Marketing strategies, and Financial lessons in the lesson as well. The entire project is put in a portfolio and presented to the teacher (and other volunteers like other teachers, business or math perhaps, and/or local business owners) and the other class members. They would share their goals, ideas, inspiration and more importantly their food with us. We would share in their vision, celebrate their success, and critique their efforts. The presentations can take multiple class days depending on the size of the class.
The commercials can be made using video (acting it out) or pictures (with narration and script overlay) depending on time and resources available.
